## [Unreleased]

skif has not been released. 0.1.0 will be the first release and will contain everything listed here.

### Added

- **Manifest and workspace rules** with stable ids, severities and autofixes: `empty-dependencies`,
  `incompatible-peer-dependencies`, `local-path-dependency`, `member-toolchain-fields`,
  `missing-package-manifest`, `root-package-dependencies`, `root-package-manager-field`,
  `root-package-private-field`, `types-in-dependencies`, `unmatched-workspace-patterns` and
  `unsorted-dependencies`.
- **Version, semver-range and catalog policies**: version groups, semver groups, banned dependencies,
  dependency families, workspace-protocol and catalog rules, with catalog resolution for pnpm, package.json
  and bun catalogs and recursive workspace globs (`**`) with pnpm semantics.
- **JS analysis on oxc** with 13 rules: `unused-files`, `unused-dependencies`, `unused-dev-dependencies`,
  `unused-optional-peer-dependencies`, `unlisted-dependencies`, `unlisted-binaries`, `unresolved-imports`,
  `unused-exports`, `unused-types`, `unused-enum-members`, `unused-namespace-members`, `duplicate-exports` and
  `circular-imports`. Unused files, exports, types and dev dependencies default to warnings. Production mode,
  `--no-js` and `[js]` settings per workspace are supported.
- **A plugin table** that reads the static configuration of common tools to find entry files and the
  dependencies they use, without running any tool.
- **Output formats**: human, JSON, SARIF and GitHub annotations, selected with `--format`.
- **Atomic fixes**: `--fix` and `--fix-unsafe` plan all edits first, write them atomically and lint again;
  edits keep key order, indentation and newline style. `--fix` runs the package manager's install unless
  `--no-install` is given.
- **`skif.toml` configuration** with a committed JSON Schema (`skif schema`), `skif init` and `skif rules`.
- **npm package as a napi-rs addon** for Node 24+ and Bun on macOS and Linux (glibc and musl), plus release
  archives for Windows, `cargo binstall`, Homebrew and Scoop.
- **Git hooks** for pre-commit, Poly and Lefthook, and a GitHub Action (`Goldziher/skif@v0`).

### Changed

- Minimum supported versions raised: Rust 1.99.
- **The project is renamed to skif.** It continues as an independent Rust dependency linter for
  JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos, hosted at `github.com/Goldziher/skif`.
- **The code is a library-first workspace** of `skif-*` crates with a thin `skif` command line on top.
  Architecture decisions are recorded in `adrs/`.
